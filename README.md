#Interview Questions
######I have been through a lot of interviews in my life, both in person and phone screens. I have also taught a bunch of developers on how to crack interviews. 

######This page will list the most common questions I have faced in the recent years. This collection will focus primarily on front-end. I will expand to other areas if there is interest. To start with, I'll focus on four primary front-end technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* jQuery
